description: Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md and README.md to sync with current skills, commands and features
---

Use the Task tool with subagent_type='quick-reference-sync' to analyze the current state of skills and commands, then update QUICK_REFERENCE.md to reflect:

1. All available skill commands (Productboard, Dovetail, and any new skills)
2. Command syntax and parameters
3. Usage examples
4. Any changes to skill behavior or functionality

Update README.md to reflect:
1. New core functionality that needs to be mentioned in README.md
2. Additional configuration steps that need to be documented for the toolbox to work
3. Additional setup steps that are needed if relevant. 

After updating, report what changes were made to keep documentation in sync with the implementation.
