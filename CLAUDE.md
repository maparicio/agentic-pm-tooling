# Claude Code Guidelines when developing in this project

- Always update project-progress.md when the project changes (facts only, no recommendations)
- Commit to git frequently with clear summaries - commits are pointers when context clears
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (~163 lines): command summaries only, point to detailed skill docs
- Individual skill docs (.claude/skills/*.md): comprehensive examples and details
- Always add tests when implementing features (target ~80% coverage)
- Use git history as a helper if necessary

# Guidelines when using the assests (skills, agents and "/"-commands in this project)
- Always check the QUICK_REFERENCE.md for what skills you have available to solve particular tasks
- Run sub-agents when you deem necessary. Check what agents you have available
- When you create assets like a confluence page, ALWAYS write a "Generated by AI warning on the top!"
- Use PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md as reference when triaging and assessing insights from for example Productboard or Dovetail or when creating PRDs. If there is no such file, tell the user that they need to specify this using the PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md.example file as template
- ALWAYS use the workspace/ folder for all generated files and content (PRDs, reports, exports, etc.). Never generate files in the project root or other directories
