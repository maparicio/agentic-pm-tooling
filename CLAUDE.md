# Claude Code Guidelines

- Always update project-progress.md when the project changes (facts only, no recommendations)
- Commit to git frequently with clear summaries - commits are pointers when context clears
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (~163 lines): command summaries only, point to detailed skill docs
- Individual skill docs (.claude/skills/*.md): comprehensive examples and details
- Always add tests when implementing features (target ~80% coverage)
- Use git history as a helper if necessary
